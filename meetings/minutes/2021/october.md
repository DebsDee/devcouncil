## Present
Lola - developer advocate at samsung internet, also involved in open webe docs. I wanted to be a part of this because I found the w3c very overwhelming and difficult to navigate, and thought this would be a great way to make the w3c more accessible. I also didn't know what the w3c was, and I wanted to make that clearer once I found out. I also want to make the w3c more accessible to folks in non western places.

Jacky - Currently freelancing. My interests are arount the open social web, which lead me here. Trying to put those social web standards to put them in plain english. Making the information more accessible to folks to no

Boaz - note taker.

Debs - design and tech coop in the UK - equiping local communities with digitial infrastructure. many of the people we work with are not aware of the w3c, and so we want to make tha topen. I'm also a community organizer, I used to run afrotech fest.

Mike - I met lola in OWD, and am looking forward to supporting this group. I've been in the w3c since 2007. Before that I worked at opera on the mobile version of the browser. Before that I worked on another mobile browser in the early days. I live in tokyo. In recent years I started working with Dominique at the w3c who leads the w3c dev rel team. I would like to see this group take back the word developer to also mean someone who makes websites. Want to figure out user problems and developer problems.

Things that stood out
* working with other dev advocate groups outside the W3C. E.g. the web we want https://webwewant.org
* how we're going to do the things we want to do: be a bi directional comms between devs and the w3c. Let's think about it in layers. One layer is eduction.
* when we are working with the w3c, a way to intro them to us would be an inreach to them, so they can do outreach. E.g. the web xr wg and saying hey we want you to come and speak to devs about the work we're doing.
* there are quite a few more suggestions in the doc.
